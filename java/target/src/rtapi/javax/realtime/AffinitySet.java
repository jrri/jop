/**
 * This class is the API for all processor-affinity-related aspects of SCJ. It
 * includes a factory that generates AffinitySet objects, and methods that
 * control the default affinity sets used when affinity set inheritance does not
 * apply.
 * 
 * Affinity sets implement the concept of SCJ scheduling allocation domains.
 * They provide the mechanism by which the programmer can specify the processors
 * on which managed schedulable objects can execute.
 * 
 * The processor membership of an affinity set is immutable. SCJ constrains the
 * use of RTSJ affinity sets so that the affinity of a managed schedulable
 * object can only be set during the initialization phase.
 * 
 * The internal representation of a set of processors in an affinity set
 * instance is not specified. Each processor/core in the system is given a
 * unique logical number. The relationship between logical and physical
 * processors is implementation-defined.
 * 
 * The affinity set factory cannot create an affinity set with more than one
 * processor member, but such affinity sets are supported as predefined affinity
 * sets at Level 2.
 * 
 * A managed schedulable object inherits its creatorâ€™s affinity set. Every
 * managed schedulable object is associated with a processor affinity set
 * instance, either explicitly assigned, inherited, or defaulted.
 * 
 * See also Services.getSchedulingAllocationDoamins()

 * @author Juan Rios
 * @version SCJ 0.93
 * @note An AffinitySet at L0 and L1 has a single processor. At Level 0 there
 *       can be only one AffinitySet. At Level 1 there can be more than one
 *       AffinitySets, each with only one processor meaning that schedulable
 *       objects execute in only one processor (no task migration). L2 provides
 *       predefined AffinitySets with more than one processor members. Can two
 *       different AffinitySets at L2 have a processor in common? How are
 *       AffinitySets for L1 applications created (the generate() method is
 *       available only at L2)?
 * 
 * @note As the hierarchy of ManagedLongEventHandler is not a sub clas of
 *       BoundAsyncLongEventHandler, the setProcessorAffinity() and
 *       getAffinitySet() methods are modified to accept
 *       AbstractAsyncEventHandler instead.
